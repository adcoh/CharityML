    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "I've decided to list three models (two simple and one ensemble) that I think are appropriate for the data set: Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes has ben applied in Spam Filters to calculate the probability of whether a given email is Spam by analyzing the prevalence of words and combinations of words in emails known to be Spam and not Spam.\n",
    "A Naive Bayes model is simple and fast to implement as it's based on a rather simple probability calculation, and even if the \"naiveness\" assumption of conditional independence between the features doesn't hold in the real world it can still produce a robust model. It can also handle both continuous and discrete data and is  making it very versatile and scalable. (https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-using-a-naive-Bayes-for-classification)\n",
    "It's weaknesses are also connected to its simplicity, as it might not perform as well as more sophisticated algorithms when these are tuned properly (https://elitedatascience.com/machine-learning-algorithms). It's a good candidate since it can be scaled to a larger dataset such as ours and can perhaps be tweaked further by introducing prior probabilities to deal with the likely violation of the conditional indepence between the features. The speed of Naive Bayes is not much of a factor as we're not looking to apply this model in a live environment, which is usually where a fast run-time is more important \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees have been used to auto-classify galaxies found by the Hubble telescope and filter out noise in its images (http://legacydirs.umiacs.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html).\n",
    "It's strengths include being able to learn non-linear relationships, they're robust to outliers, and like NB it's fast and easy to build and the results are easily interpretable (https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/datamine.111/b28129/algo_decisiontree.htm#CACCJCEJ). It also performs well with little hyper-parameter tuning (http://blog.echen.me/2011/04/27/choosing-a-machine-learning-classifier/). It's disadvantages includes a risk of overfitting, especially if the feature-set is large, however this drawback can be mitigated by using multiple trees, i.e. Random Forest, as described below. The speed of decision trees are also not much of a factor as we're not looking to apply this model in a live environment, which is usually where a fast run-time is more important\n",
    "It's a good candidate for our data set as there may be a lot of interdependent features and Decision Trees are usually good at dealing with these. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest has been applied in remote sensing due to the accuracy of the classification.(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616000265)\n",
    "Random Forests have the same advantages as Decision Trees but has the added benefit of avoiding overfitting as it creates multiple trees with random feature subsets and train each one on the data. The prediction for a new point will be the majority decision of the \"forest\" and thus avoid the memorization tendency of a single Decision Tree. They also perform well without a lot of hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "Disadvantages are that it's slower than the two methods described above. The more trees you add the less likely it is to overfit, but also slows down the runtime. In this scenario it might not be much of an obstacle since \n",
    "I think this model will be the strongest one of the three as there are a lot of features in the dataset and we want to avoid overfitting."

    "Of the models chosen RandomForestClassifier showed the best results in terms of both accuracy and Fscore on both the training and testing sets, closely followed by DecisionTreeClassifier and trailing by a long way we have GaussianNB. Time-wise GaussianNB is by far the fastest, although it's not worth much, both considering the use-case and the abysmal results. Also, both RFC and DTC are overfitted, as can be seen from the large difference in both accuracy and fscore when comparing their performance on the training and testing sets. This indicates that the data is too complext for such a simple algorithm as Naive Bayes, and even more suitable algorithms such as Decision Trees and the less-overfitting-prone Random Forest also have a difficult time. To verify this I did a run with another ensemble method, the AdaBoost model, and it produced a more consistent fscore of around 0.7 on 100% of both the training and testing sets (although it was considerably slower than even RFC). I won't go forward with that model as I wasn't sharp enough to spot the need for it in the first place (and I don't want to go back and redo the model-selection question :) ), but I'd recommend to CharityML to go forward with the RandomForestClassifier model since it performs quite well and there's considerable potential for tweaking the hyperparameters and achieving a less overfitted model. The dataset is clearly complex enough to require an ensemble method."

    "To explain Random Forest we first need to understand decision trees, as Random Forest uses multiple decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the features in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "A decision tree works by splitting the data into smaller, more homogenous subsets, and for each split the groups branch off and the algorithm splits them further into even more homogenous groups. This eventually creates a series of simple yes/no questions that can be asked of new data points, where each answer branches off and ends in a \"leaf\" where the model makes its final decision on how to classify a given data point. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest gets its name from being a collection of Decision Trees that have all been trained on the same data points but each tree has split the data using a random subset of the features. So we have a \"forest\" of many trees whose branches and leaves \"randomly\" shaped. The model makes its final predictions by letting each tree in the forest \"vote\" on how to classify a new data point, and the majority decision is the one that wins the day. This preserves the efficiency and versatility of decision trees in splitting the data and finding a good decision boundary while avoiding the tendency of a lone tree to overfit or simply \"memorize\" the data by shaping the split in a too granular of a fashion."

By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do.

    "Thinking of the features as demographic markers, there are a couple of baselines regarding income and demographics to keep in mind, according to the US Census (https://census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2017/demo/P60-259.pdf): 1. More years spent in school translate to a higher median income (https://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_001.htm), 2. Marital status is another differentiator, with married couples tending to have higher incomes, 3. Women earn approximately 80% of what men earn, 4. Age is a large differentiator when it comes to income, as more years in the workforce usually translates to higher income, 5. Race is another major differentiator in average income, with real median household income for black people being about 20,000 dollars less than for all races together, 6. People with higher levels of wealth tend to have higher incomes as well, 7. Income levels are different for different occupation classes as well\n",

    "Sex and race are the broadest splits and might therefore not be the most precise. Age is probably a better differentiator in that case, along with years of education. Capital Gains can also be a good proxy for income level as it is an indication of wealth. Occupation will probably also be a pretty informative feature. I'm less certain about relationship status as I'm not sure I can visualize how the different combinations of . \n",

    "I listed all of them except for hours-per-week, and seemingly placed them in reverse order of importance. Education and capital gains are less important than Age and marital status, and specifically being married. It does make sense that Age is the most important feature and it seems trivial (although it clearly isn't) that working more hours leads to a higher income. That capital gain is in the list confirms the idea that wealth and income are linked, as does the apperance of education-num confirm the correlation between education level and income."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
